      Granovetter begins by looking at balance theory. In brief, balance theory
      tells us that if an actor, A, is strongly tied to both B and C, it is
      extremely likely that B and C are, sooner or later, going to be tied to
      each other (1973:1363). Granovetter argues that because of this, bridge
      ties between cliques are always weak ties (1973:1364). Weak ties may not
      necessarily be bridges, but Granovetter argues that bridges will be weak
